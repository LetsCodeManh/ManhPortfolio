# Welcome to my Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my skills, experiences, and projects as a web developer.

## About Me!

Hi, I'm Manh, a motivated and dedicated individual with a passion for web development and business. I recently completed a full-stack web developer bootcamp and I am eager to apply my skills to a new challenge as a web developer. I am confident that I will be a valuable addition to any organization.

## Skills

Frontend: HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Angular, Angular Material, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS

Backend: NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Postgres, Postman, Firebase, Google API, Google OAuth2

Testing: Jest, Enzyme, Puppeteer, Atatus

Webpack: Parcel, Vite

Publish: GitHub, Heroku, Netlify

## Projects

During my web development bootcamp, I learned 80% of the above skills and it was a fun and challenging experience. I encountered errors and learned how to fix them, and the key was to just keep trying until I succeeded. The most challenging aspect for me was on the backend side, since I had less knowledge in that area. However, I found it interesting and nice to understand what happens there.

## Experience

I started as a technical product designer, but I wanted to try something new, so I decided to create my own business and learn from the internet. After a while, I chose the programming path and started as a programmer with no knowledge. I attempted freelancing, but it was a failure. I continued learning and applied for jobs, and eventually got into a web development bootcamp. From November 2022 to January 2023, I completed the bootcamp as a full-stack developer and created this portfolio to apply for jobs. This time, I have more knowledge and experience.
